vigil_pie_common.py

Shared helpers for the Vigil MCP toolsets.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Every call in here is version-sensitive: the PIE world lookup, actor
resolution, component fetch, deferred spawn. Unreal MCP is Experimental and
this was authored against documentation rather than a running editor, so the
odds that at least one of these needs adjusting are high.

Putting them in one module means adjusting is a one-line edit in one file
instead of a hunt through four. That is the entire justification -- there is
no cleverness here, just a single point of failure by choice rather than by
accident.
